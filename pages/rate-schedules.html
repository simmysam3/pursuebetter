        <h2>Participation Units</h2>
        
        <p>The Pursuit System uses Participation Units (PU) as its core unit of account—a USD-pegged stablecoin that rewards engagement in sanctioned activities. The base PU value is calibrated to provide meaningful supplemental income for active participants while scaling to full-time equivalency for those deeply engaged in competitive pursuits.</p>
        
        <div class="pullquote">
            <blockquote>Base PU Value: $21.00</blockquote>
            <cite>Targeting ~$50,000 annual supplement <span>for 36 hours/week participation</span></cite>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Activity Multipliers</h2>
        
        <p>Different activity types earn PUs at different rates, reflecting the physical and social value of engagement. The first physical activity each day earns a 2.5× bonus ($52.50/hour), incentivizing daily activation. Additional athletic participation earns 2.0× ($42.00/hour), non-athletic guild participation earns 1.5× ($31.50/hour), and attendance earns the base 1.0× rate ($21.00/hour).</p>
        
        <p>This creates a natural earning spectrum. Someone doing minimal engagement—one hour per day at base rate, six days per week—earns approximately $6,552 annually. An observer maxing out at 2 PU per day reaches $13,104. The target supplement of $50,000 requires mixed activities totaling 36 hours weekly. At the high end, someone engaged in 8 hours of physical activity daily can earn $108,108 annually before any competition bonuses.</p>
        
        <h2>Competition Classes</h2>
        
        <p>Competitive activities are organized into development and competitive tiers. All B-classes (1B through 4B) are recreational and developmental—they encourage participation and allow competitors to match up with others of similar skill levels. There are no win bonuses in B-classes; the focus is purely on engagement.</p>
        
        <p>A-classes introduce escalating rewards for competitive success. In 1A competition, winning team participants and coaches receive 4× their base PUs. The multiplier increases to 8× in 2A, 15× in 3A (elite), and 25× in 4A (professional). Losing teams receive the base rate. This creates meaningful stratification between developmental and competitive tracks, with professional-tier participants able to earn substantial income through competitive excellence.</p>
        
        <h2>Coaching and Event Organization</h2>
        
        <p>Team coaches receive a fixed rate of 5.5 PU per event regardless of roster size. This prevents gaming through roster inflation while not penalizing coaches who maintain lean rosters. Future iterations will establish sport-specific fixed counts per activity class.</p>
        
        <p>Event owners are rewarded for both participant engagement and spectator draw. Participant engagement follows a Fibonacci decay model (÷16), while spectator attendance earns a flat 0.333 PU per head with no decay. This incentivizes organizers to build events that attract both active participants and engaged audiences.</p>
        
        <h2>Guild and Academy Operations</h2>
        
        <p>Guilds and Academies receive facility credits of $5 per participant hour (approximately 0.24 PU) to offset operational costs. This blended rate accounts for venue cost variation—from near-zero municipal fields to premium facilities like ice rinks. Some activities may not be economically feasible under the base credit structure; rates will be adjusted per activity class based on pilot data.</p>

        <h2>Pilot Implementation</h2>
        
        <h3>Wave 1: Proof of Concept</h3>
        
        <p>The initial pilot targets the Spokane metropolitan area with 1,000 active participants and 10,000 observers (11,000 total enrolled). The program runs for 30 weeks across three 10-week competitive seasons, with budget covering program establishment, activity operations, and transition funding to achieve Wave 2 adoption. Estimated budget: approximately $175 million.</p>
        
        <h3>Wave 2: Regional Expansion</h3>
        
        <p>Wave 2 scales to 20,000 total participants. The observer role is absorbed—once enrolled, individuals join various guilds or academies rather than remaining passive observers. Estimated annual budget: $1.285 billion. Wave 2 funding is contingent on Wave 1 success metrics, specifically maintaining over 50% of guilds at full roster capacity.</p>
        
        <h3>Beyond Wave 2</h3>
        
        <p>At regional scale, the objective is to demonstrate sufficient proof of concept that federal transfer payments begin shifting from traditional welfare programs into remuneration-for-participation programs. At this stage, Pursuit transitions to serve as the distribution and validation layer for government-funded infrastructure, with lawmakers determining the ultimate tax structure for funding the means of production.</p>
