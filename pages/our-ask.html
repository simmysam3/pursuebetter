    <article>
        <p>We have a choice—begin proving out systems of economic agency, pursuit and reward, or face the potential breakdown of capitalist society as we know it. Relying on elected officials to implement and demonstrate new and novel systems of value creation and exchange could quite literally be catastrophic.</p>
        
        <p>Our objective is to be the experiment machine—to run trials and execute means of distribution to support this brave new world. We are seeking funding to begin paving a known path forward in a new age of post-labor abundance. In demonstrating digital ledger based systems along with an activation accounting platform will inform the available options to elected leaders. Post-labor systems of tax and transfer to insure against circumstances arising from labor destruction. Critically this must be demonstrated at a rate of pace greater than the call for socialist policy, which already appears to be gaining traction.</p>
        
        <p>Our objective is to be part of the conversation and our systems of addressing post-labor economics be key talking points leading up to the 2028 elections. The economics of participation should be a well recognized opportunity to address economic participation challenges, and that the core ledger and accounting platform be considered a proven means of execution.</p>
        
        <h2>Horizon 1</h2>
        
        <p>To achieve this the first horizon is establishing a core team facilitating public outreach and education, establishment of a governmental lobby community, publishing and cycling through request for comments phases for system native policy refinements, execution of proof of concept platform software requirements. We hope to have the bulk of this work executed including fundraising to support Horizon 2 heading into 2027.</p>
        
        <h2>Horizon 2</h2>
        
        <p>Through public and private funding we will execute proof of concept programs that provide participation opportunities along with part-time/supplemental employment equivalency remuneration programs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the platform, and the ability to effectively engage community audiences. This will be focused on limited activity types within a fixed region.</p>
        
        <h2>Horizon 3</h2>
        
        <p>Our objective is by the end of 2027 to have a fully production network of activities and participants be funded and executed, while expanding the budget and scope of activities, regions and participants as we head into 2028. A core success metric is that federal transfer payments are being shifted from traditional low requirement welfare programs into remuneration for participation programs, executed on the PursueBetter.org platform.</p>
        
        <p>As a not-for-profit organization we aspire to lead the charge and be the platform of choice for execution of the participation network approach—however we don't have to be 'right' and we don't have to be the platform of choice. What is critical to our mission is that a path forward is established embracing the economics of participation as a bulwark of American capitalism.</p>
        
        <p>We are looking for those who have substantially benefitted from the American system of capitalism to commit funding to testing new systems of reward and exchange.
