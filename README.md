# The Pursuit System

A framework for post-labor economics that sustains capitalism and property rights through participation-based transfer payment mechanisms.

## About

The Pursuit System is a response to the anticipated challenges of AI and automation on traditional labor markets. This project presents an economic framework that rewards participation and activation as a new economic unit, providing an alternative to traditional income-based taxation and universal basic income models.
